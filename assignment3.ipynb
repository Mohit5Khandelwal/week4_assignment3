    "\n",
    "    Abstraction focuses on the essential properties and behaviors of an object or system while hiding unnecessary details. It allows us to create higher-level concepts and models by defining interfaces, abstract classes, or interfaces that provide a simplified view of the system. Abstraction is about defining what an object does, without specifying how it does it.\n",

    "    Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together into a single unit called a class. It provides a way to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object and expose only the necessary methods or properties. Encapsulation is about grouping related data and behavior into a cohesive unit."
